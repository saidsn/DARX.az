Hello! 
Your all your files are encrypted and only I can decrypt them. Contact for me e-mail:
support4568@mail.fr or support7164@firemail.cc
Write me if you want to return your files - I can do it very quickly!
The header of the letter must contain the extension of the encryptor

Do not rename encrypted files.
You may lose your files permanently.
You may be a victim of fraud.
To prove that I can recover your files, I am ready to decrypt any three files for free (except databases, Excel and backups)
!!! Do not turn off or restart the NAS equipment. This will result in data loss !!!
